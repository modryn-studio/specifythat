# Wishlist — SpecifyThat

> Raw feature ideas, UX friction notes, and future directions. Not prioritized.

---

- Wish I didn't have to click 'I don't know' every time — wish it all just loaded together, then had an edit button at the end after user reviews each question if they want
- Relabel as a planning and prompt engine
- Skinnier header
- May have to change the name bc of SpecifyApp, but they did sunset 11/24
- May need to change the build sequence to spec out that this can all be done in one day with Opus
- Can we incorporate UI into this? Like a theme question
- Why does it always get held up at 95%?
- The date is wrong on the final spec
- Is it a one-paragraph summary or a two sentence summary or just a quick summary?
- I always ask Sonnet 4.5 to review the spec and ask questions until 95% sure it can complete the job — and I ask "what would a top 0.1% person in field do" — what if the system could auto do that for me?
- End message should say "paste prompt into your favorite AI creator" (Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Emergent, Bolt, etc.)
- Could collect people's top Stack rankings and build a comparison site — who is best for vibe coding? (separate project)
- Add UX structure

Wish list for SpecifyThat:

wish i didn't have to click 'i don't know' every time.
wish it all just loaded together
then it would have an edit button at the end after user reviews each question if they want.

relabel as a planning and prompt engine 

skinnier header

may have to change the name bc of SpecifyApp, but they did sunset 11/24

may need to change the build sequence to spec out that this can all be done in one day with opus

can we incorporate ui into this? like a theme question

why does it always get held up at 95%?

the date is wrong on the final spec

is it a one-paragraph summary or a two sentence summary or just a quick summary?


i always ask sonnet 4.5 to review the spec and ask question until 95% sure it can complete the job. 
and i ask what would a top 0.1% person in field do.
	- what if the system could auto do that for me?


end message should say 'paste prompt into your favorite ai creator' (or is that called the 'Stack'?) ie cursor, vs code copilot, emergent, bolt, etc.

maybe i could get affiliate stuff




or, even better than affiliate stuff, this could just have people rank their top Stack.  i could collect the info and build comparison website.  who is the best for vibe coding type of thing.
but that's a different project


add ux structure

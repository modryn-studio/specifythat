# SpecifyThat — Brand & Voice

## Voice
- Short sentences. Direct. No jargon.
- Conversational but competent — like a sharp friend who happens to know product strategy
- Confident without being arrogant. The tool does the work; the copy just explains it.
- Honest about limitations — "your progress isn't saved between sessions" is said plainly, not hidden
- Never use: "powerful", "seamless", "revolutionary", "unlock", "AI-powered", "AI-first"

## The User
Solo builders who have an idea and want to start coding — not write a spec.
They know planning matters but they skip it because it feels like homework.
They want the output without the process.

## Visual Rules
- Color mode: Dark mode base (warm grays, ChatGPT-like palette), no light mode toggle needed
- Accent color: Indigo (#6366f1 primary, #4f46e5 hover)
- Fonts: Inter (body + headings) — clean, neutral, stays out of the way. NOTE: current layout.tsx uses Inter, old brand guide said Geist. Inter is the decision. Align all references.
- Motion: Purposeful only — progress animations during AI generation, fade-ins on phase transitions. Use CSS animations from globals.css, not framer-motion. No decorative motion.
- Avoid: No stock photos, no fake testimonials, no popups, no "trusted by 10,000+ users" before you have 10

## Emotional Arc
- Land → "Oh, this actually does the part I always skip"
- Start → "That was easy — I just described my idea"
- Generate → "It's asking the right questions. Better than I would."
- Finish → "I have a spec I can actually use. That took 2 minutes."
- Return → "I use this every time I start something new"

## Copy Examples (Use These as Reference)
- Hero: "Turn a vague idea into a build-ready spec in under 60 seconds."
- CTA: "Start a spec"
- Empty state: "Describe your project in a few sentences. We'll handle the rest."
- Ideation mode: "Not sure what to build? We'll figure it out together."
- Spec complete: "Your spec is ready. Copy it, download it, paste it into your AI tool."
- Free trial limit: "You've used your free specs today. Get credits to keep going."
- Credit purchase: "Pay for what you use. No subscription. No account."
- Error: "Something went wrong. Try again."
- Footer: "Your prompts never leave your device."

## Positioning
SpecifyThat is NOT an AI product. It's a planning tool that happens to use AI.
Lead with the outcome (a build-ready spec in 60 seconds), not the technology.

The differentiator is the local-first, no-account, pay-per-use model — but
don't lead with that either. Lead with the speed and quality of the output.
The philosophy shows up in the experience: no signup wall, no paywall before
value, credits not subscriptions.

## Competitive Framing (Internal Only — Never in Copy)
- vs. ChatGPT/Claude direct: SpecifyThat adds structure. Raw chat gives you a blob. This gives you a spec.
- vs. other spec tools: They require accounts, charge monthly, and store your data. We don't.
- vs. doing it manually: Nobody does it manually. That's the point.

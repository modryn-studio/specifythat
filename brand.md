## Voice

How the product sounds in UI copy, headings, CTAs, and error messages.

- Short sentences. Direct. No padding.
- Confident without being arrogant. You know what this does and you say it plainly.
- Honest about what doesn't exist yet. No vaporware copy.
- Never use: "powerful, seamless, revolutionary, unlock, supercharge, game-changer, next-level"

---

## The User

Impatient builders who hate project planning but know they need a spec before they start. They want the thinking done for them — fast — so they can get back to building.

---

## Visual Rules

- Color mode: Dark mode base
- Accent color: <!-- TODO: confirm accent hex from Tailwind config -->
- Fonts: <!-- TODO: confirm font from layout.tsx -->
- Motion: Minimal. Loading states only.
- Avoid: No fake testimonials, no stock photos, no popups

## Emotional Arc

What a visitor feels at each stage — land, read, scroll, convert.

- Land: "Wait — this does that in 60 seconds?"
- Read: "That's exactly the problem I have."
- Scroll: "OK this is actually real."
- Convert: "I'm trying this right now."

## Copy Examples

Real copy to use as reference when writing UI text.

- Hero: "Spec your project in 60 seconds."
- CTA: "Start for free"
- Subhead: "Answer two questions. AI handles the rest."
- Error: "Something went wrong. Try again."
- Empty state: "Your spec will appear here."

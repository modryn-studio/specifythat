# SpecifyThat — Brand & Voice

## Voice
- Short sentences. Direct. No jargon.
- Conversational but competent — like a sharp friend who happens to know product strategy
- Confident without being arrogant. The tool does the work; the copy just explains it.
- Honest about limitations — state them plainly, never hide them
- Never use: "powerful", "seamless", "revolutionary", "unlock", "AI-powered", "AI-first"
- Lead with the outcome (context file in 60 seconds), not the technology

## The User
Solo builders who have an idea and want to start coding — not write a spec.
They know planning matters but they skip it because it feels like homework.
They want the output without the process.

They don't know what a copilot-instructions.md file is, or why it matters.
They just know their AI tool drifts off course when it doesn't have context.
SpecifyThat gives them the file without making them learn the system.

## Visual Rules
- Color mode: Dark mode base (warm grays, ChatGPT-like palette), light mode toggle available
- Accent color: Indigo (#6366f1 primary, #4f46e5 hover)
- Fonts: Inter (body + headings) — clean, neutral, stays out of the way. Inter is the decision. Align all references.
- Motion: Purposeful only — progress animations during AI generation, fade-ins on phase transitions. Use CSS animations from globals.css, not framer-motion. No decorative motion.
- Avoid: No stock photos, no fake testimonials, no popups, no "trusted by 10,000+ users" before you have 10

## Emotional Arc
- Land → "Oh, this actually does the part I always skip"
- Start → "That was easy — I just described my idea"
- Generate → "It's asking the right questions. Better than I would."
- Finish → "I have a file I can paste straight into my editor. That took 60 seconds."
- Return → "I use this every time I start something new"

## Copy Examples (Use These as Reference)
- Hero: "Get the context file your AI coding tool needs. In under 60 seconds."
- CTA: "Start building"
- Empty state: "Describe your project in a few sentences. We'll handle the rest."
- Ideation mode: "Not sure what to build? We'll figure it out together."
- Output ready: "Your file is ready. Copy it, download it, paste it into your editor."
- Free trial limit: "You've used your free generations today. Get credits to keep going."
- Credit purchase: "Pay for what you use. No subscription. No account."
- Error: "Something went wrong. Try again."
- Footer: "Your prompts never leave your device."
- Explainer: "This is the file your AI coding tool needs to understand your project. Paste it into your editor's instructions, and every prompt you write will have this context."

## Positioning
SpecifyThat is NOT an AI product. It's a context tool that happens to use AI.
Lead with the outcome (a context file in 60 seconds), not the technology.

The output is a `copilot-instructions.md` file — the same format professional
developers use to give AI tools project context. Most builders don't know
this file exists. SpecifyThat generates it for them without requiring them
to learn the system.

The differentiator is the local-first, no-account, pay-per-use model — but
don't lead with that either. Lead with the speed and quality of the output.
The philosophy shows up in the experience: no signup wall, no paywall before
value, credits not subscriptions.

## Competitive Framing (Internal Only — Never in Copy)
- vs. ChatGPT/Claude direct: Raw chat gives you a blob. SpecifyThat gives you structured context your AI tool actually reads.
- vs. BrainGrid: Requires signup, cloud storage, subscriptions, CLI installs. 2,000+ builders but violates every Modryn principle. We give you a text box, 60 seconds, and a file that goes straight into your editor.
- vs. other spec tools: They produce PRDs nobody reads. We produce context files AI tools consume.
- vs. doing it manually: Most devs don't even know these files exist. That's the point.

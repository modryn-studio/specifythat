# [Project Name] — Copilot Context

## Who I Am
<!-- TODO: describe yourself, your product, and your target user -->

## Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vercel for deployment
- GA4 for custom event tracking (via `@/lib/analytics.ts` — never call `gtag()` directly)
- Vercel Analytics `<Analytics />` component in `layout.tsx` for pageviews only — do not use their `track()` API
<!-- TODO: add project-specific services (e.g. Resend, Stripe, Prisma, Supabase) -->

## Project Structure
```
/app                    → Next.js App Router pages
/components             → Reusable UI components
/lib                    → Utilities, helpers, data fetching
<!-- TODO: add any project-specific directories -->
```

## Route Map
<!-- TODO: list every route and what it does -->
- `/`                → (home)
- `/privacy`         → Privacy policy
- `/terms`           → Terms of service

## Brand & Voice

## API Route Logging

Every new API route (`app/api/**/route.ts`) MUST use `createRouteLogger` from `@/lib/route-logger`.

```typescript
import { createRouteLogger } from '@/lib/route-logger';
const log = createRouteLogger('my-route');

export async function POST(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const ctx = log.begin();
  try {
    log.info(ctx.reqId, 'Request received', { /* key fields */ });
    // ... handler body ...
    return log.end(ctx, Response.json(result), { /* key result fields */ });
  } catch (error) {
    log.err(ctx, error);
    return Response.json({ error: 'Internal error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

- `begin()` prints the `─` separator + START line with a 5-char `reqId`
- `info()` / `warn()` log mid-request milestones
- `end()` logs ✅ with elapsed ms and returns the response
- `err()` logs ❌ with elapsed ms
- Never use raw `console.log` in routes — always go through the logger

## Analytics

All custom events MUST go through `analytics` from `@/lib/analytics.ts` — never call `gtag()` directly.

```typescript
import { analytics } from '@/lib/analytics';
analytics.track('event_name', { prop: value });
```

Add a named method to `analytics.ts` for each distinct user action. Named methods are typed and discoverable — no magic strings scattered across 10 files.

GA4 measurement ID is loaded via `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in `layout.tsx`.

## Dev Server

Start with `Ctrl+Shift+B` (default build task). This runs:
```
npm run dev -- --port 3000 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath dev.log
```
Tell Copilot **"check logs"** at any point — it reads `dev.log` and flags errors or slow requests.

## Code Style
- Write as a senior engineer: minimal surface area, obvious naming, no abstractions before they're needed
- Comments explain WHY, not what
- One file = one responsibility
- Prefer early returns for error handling
- Never break existing functionality when adding new features
- Leave TODO comments for post-launch polish items

## Core Rules
- Every page earns its place — no pages for businesses not yet running
- Ship fast, stay honest — empty is better than fake
- Ugly is acceptable, broken is not — polish the core action ruthlessly
- Ship one killer feature, not ten mediocre ones
- Instrument analytics before features — data from day one
- Onboard users to value in under 2 minutes

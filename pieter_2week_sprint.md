# 2-Week Product Sprint (Pieter Levels Method)

**Goal**: Build and ship ONE product publicly. Let the internet tell you if it matters.

**Core Philosophy**: Don't validate. Don't interview. Don't cold call. Just build what YOU need and ship it fast.

---

## Days 1-3: Build Something You Actually Need

### Action: Pick ONE problem YOU have right now

Ask yourself:
- What manual task wastes 2+ hours of my week?
- What do I currently do in a spreadsheet that annoys me?
- What would make my life easier TODAY?

**Examples**:
- Personal finance tracker that doesn't suck
- Simple project/task manager that fits YOUR workflow
- Tool to automate something at your day job
- Anything you currently do manually that pisses you off

### Rules:
- **It must solve YOUR problem** (not a hypothetical customer's problem)
- **You must need it TODAY** (not "people might want this someday")
- **48-hour build max** (if it takes longer, scope it down)

### Your Tasks:
- [ ] Write a 1-page spec using your template (2 hours max)
- [ ] Build the MVP (48 hours max)
- [ ] Use it yourself for 24 hours
- [ ] Fix the 2-3 most annoying things

**Output**: A working tool that YOU actually use

---

## Days 4-5: Ship It Publicly

### Action: Post it everywhere

**Where to post**:
1. **Reddit** (pick 2-3 relevant subreddits):
   - r/SideProject
   - r/Entrepreneur  
   - r/InternetIsBeautiful
   - r/somethingimade
   - Industry-specific subreddits related to your tool

2. **Hacker News**:
   - Post as "Show HN: I built [thing] because I was tired of [problem]"
   - Post between 8-10am PST for best visibility

3. **Twitter/X**:
   - Tweet the link with a 2-sentence description
   - Use relevant hashtags (#buildinpublic, #indiehacker, #SaaS)

4. **Product Hunt** (optional):
   - Launch on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
   - Simple tagline: "I built this to solve my own problem"

### The Post Script (Use This Everywhere):

> **Title**: I built [tool name] because I was tired of [specific problem]
> 
> **Body**:
> I kept running into [problem]. Existing solutions were [too expensive / too complex / didn't exist].
> 
> So I built [tool name]. It does [3 things max].
> 
> It's free. Here's the link: [URL]
> 
> Let me know what you think.

**That's it. No pitch. No features. No "please sign up."**

### Your Tasks:
- [ ] Create a simple landing page (can be a README on GitHub)
- [ ] Make sure it's actually usable by strangers (test the UX)
- [ ] Post to Reddit (2-3 subreddits)
- [ ] Post to Hacker News
- [ ] Tweet about it
- [ ] Post to Product Hunt (optional)

**Output**: Your product is live and posted in 5+ places

## Days 6-14: Observe and Iterate

### Action: Watch what happens. Don't force anything.

**Success Signals** (in order of importance):

1. **100+ people use it in first week**
   - Add a "Buy me a coffee" button
   - Add simple analytics (users, pageviews)
   - If 5+ people donate → you have real demand

2. **People ask questions or request features**
   - Answer every question
   - Note feature requests but DON'T build them yet
   - This is market research without asking

3. **It gets shared organically**
   - Posted in other communities
   - Retweeted
   - Mentioned in newsletters or blogs

4. **Someone says "I'd pay for this"**
   - Reply: "What would you pay?"
   - Add a simple $5/month or $20/year option
   - Use Stripe payment links (setup in 10 minutes)

### If Nothing Happens (No traction by Day 10):

**That's totally fine. This is the numbers game.**

Most projects don't get traction. Pieter Levels had MANY failures.

Your next move:
- Spend 1 hour doing a postmortem (Why didn't this work?)
- Pick a NEW problem (something else that annoys you)
- Start building the next thing

**The goal is speed of iteration, not perfection.**

### Your Tasks:
- [ ] Check analytics daily (5 minutes)
- [ ] Respond to every comment/question within 24 hours
- [ ] Note any feature requests (don't build them yet)
- [ ] If 5+ people ask for the same feature → consider building it
- [ ] If 100+ users in Week 1 → add monetization option
- [ ] If < 10 users by Day 10 → start planning the next project

**Output**: Data on whether this problem matters to other people

---

## Decision Point: Day 14

### Option A: You Got Traction (100+ users, some willing to pay)

**Next steps**:
1. Add a simple paid tier ($5-20/month)
2. Build the #1 most-requested feature
3. Keep shipping updates weekly
4. Get to 10 paying customers
5. Once you hit $500/month → decide if you want to grow this or build the next thing

### Option B: No Traction (< 50 users, no one willing to pay)

**Next steps**:
1. Do a 30-minute postmortem:
   - Was the problem too niche?
   - Was the solution too complex?
   - Did I post it in the right places?
   - Did I solve MY problem or a hypothetical problem?

2. Start the 2-week sprint again with a NEW project
3. Build something even simpler this time
4. Ship even faster

**Remember**: Pieter Levels said "I've made a lot of stuff that just disappeared because it just didn't get any traction."

The game is volume. Build 12 things. One will hit.

## Critical Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No validation before building**
   - Don't ask "would you use this?"
   - Just build it and find out

2. **No features you don't personally need**
   - If YOU don't use it daily, don't add it
   - Build for yourself first, others second

3. **No perfectionism**
   - Ship with bugs
   - Ship with ugly UI
   - Ship with missing features
   - You can fix it later IF people care

4. **No asking for feedback before shipping**
   - Don't post "What do you think of this idea?"
   - Post "Here's the thing I built, use it"

5. **48-hour build limit**
   - If it's taking longer, you're over-scoping
   - Cut features, ship faster

6. **If it fails, move on by Day 14**
   - Don't spend months on something with no traction
   - Build the next thing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Product is live and posted publicly
- [ ] 50+ people have seen/used it
- [ ] You have data (analytics showing traffic)

### By Day 14:
- [ ] You know if this has traction or not
- [ ] If yes → you're iterating based on real user feedback
- [ ] If no → you're building the next thing

### By Month 3 (after 6 projects):
- [ ] You've shipped 6 products
- [ ] At least 1 has 100+ users
- [ ] At least 1 has someone willing to pay
- [ ] You've learned what problems people actually care about

## What to Build (Starter Ideas)

If you're stuck on what to build, here are proven starting points:

**Category 1: Tools You Need**
- A better way to track your personal finances
- A simple project/time tracker that fits YOUR workflow
- A tool to automate something annoying at your day job
- A way to organize [something you currently manage manually]

**Category 2: Directories/Lists**
- "Nomad List for [specific niche]"
- A curated list of [resources for specific audience]
- A comparison tool for [products/services in specific category]

**Category 3: Micro-Tools**
- Single-purpose calculators
- Format converters
- Data visualizers
- Simple generators

**The best first project**: Something YOU will use daily, takes 48 hours to build, and solves a problem you can describe in one sentence.

---

## Week 1 Starts Monday

**Monday**: Pick your problem and write the spec  
**Tuesday-Wednesday**: Build it  
**Thursday**: Use it yourself and fix bugs  
**Friday**: Ship it publicly  
**Saturday-Sunday**: Watch what happens  

**No excuses. No delays. No "let me think about it."**

Just build and ship.

## Final Reminder

You're not trying to build a perfect product.  
You're trying to find ONE problem that other people care about.

The only way to find it is to build shit and see what sticks.

Most of your projects will fail.  
That's the point.

Build 12 things.  
Ship them all.  
One will work.

**Go.**
